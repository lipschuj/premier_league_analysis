# Files 
This repo is divided into three files:
* get_data: web scraping of all football games from [the official website of the Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)
* data_cleaning: can't be more explicit
* eda: it's an exploratory data analysis that was, first, part of the data cleaning but as it was starting to be too long, I split the file in two.

For the EDA file, I tried many things but couldn't manage to keep the visuals plotted as I used Plotly so I replaced them with images. If you want some interactivity, you should install Plotly and run it.
