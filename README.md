This repo is about the Premier League analysis. I wanted to  understand more about the history of this League, collected all the data about the games, cleaned it, conducted an analysis and wrote an ![article](https://medium.com/@croissantboy/an-analysis-of-the-greatest-football-on-earth-interactive-article-74a057a82862) about it.

This repo is divided into three files:
* get_data: web scraping of all football games from [the official website of the Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)
* data_cleaning: can't be more explicit
* eda: it's an exploratory data analysis that was, first, part of the data cleaning but as it was starting to be too long, I split the file in two. Most of the work is in this notebook.
